There's more than one way to skin a cat. Or put more elegantly: there's more than one way to reach heavan. 

This is the meaning of the proverb "Kuna njia nyingi za kufika mbinguni" from Swahili. When faced with challenges, there can be many ways to overcome them.

I've been using coding challenges to sharpen my problem solving skills and knowledge of coding syntax. Doing this has helped me break down problems of increasing complexity and solve them. 

However, there's always a vast number of ways to solve a coding problem, each with their own advantages and trade-offs. 

With this project, I want to look for the _best_ solution to a given problem, rather than just _a_ solution. I want to use this exercise to analyse the trade-offs between different approaches and learn a lot in the process. In short, I hope to broaden my knowledge of coding syntax and sharpen my critical thinking skills, ultimately becoming a more proficient programmer.
