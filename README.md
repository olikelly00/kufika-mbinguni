# 🧑‍💻💫 Kufika Mbinguni 💫🧑‍💻

*There's more than one way to skin a cat.*  

Or, put more elegantly: there's more than one way to reach heaven.

This is the meaning of the Swahili proverb:  **"Kuna njia nyingi za kufika mbinguni."**  

The essence is the same as our English-language counterpart: when faced with challenges, there can be many ways to overcome them.

I've been using coding challenges to sharpen my problem-solving skills and knowledge of coding syntax. This has helped me break down increasingly complex problems and solve them.

However, there are always many ways to solve a coding problem, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.

With this project, I aim to explore not just *a* solution, but the *best* solution to each problem. I will analyse the trade-offs between different approaches and learn from the process. 

In short, this project is about broadening my coding knowledge, sharpening my critical thinking skills, and ultimately becoming a more proficient programmer.
